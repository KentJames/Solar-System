This is a physically accurate 3D model of the solar system. Orbits are plotted by Keplers laws and the model is run through Three.js, a library for WebGL.

Should require no work to run apart from typing this url into your browser: https://kentjames.github.io/Solar-System/ 

I also maintain another port on my blog: http://crimpspiration.com/SolarSystem

Reccomended browser for running this is in Chrome as google is leading the way on WebGL technologies. Safari is also fairly good but performance is not as good as chrome.
